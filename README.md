### Pixel Lock -
This is a casual project aimed at creating a visual encryption algorithm using Python, NumPy, and image processing techniques.

### Overview -
The visual encryption algorithm generates a visual representation of encrypted data using a configuration file. The decryption process works on the encrypted image file and the corresponding configuration file. **For a successful transfer, both parties must have the same configuration file.**
A few example config files can be found in the config folder. *Not every config file might work well.*

### Features -
- Encryption: Generates visually encrypted representations of data.
- Decryption: Decrypts visually encrypted data using a configuration file.
- Configurability: Encryption and decryption rely on a configuration file to ensure compatibility between parties.

### Requirements -
- Python
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

### Usage -
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/samarthps29/pixel-lock
```
2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the encryption algorithm:
```
python main.py
```
